so the idea is some basic data analytics tool right, where agents would go into the field to collect data from various regions in the country, and the admin side or manager side, would be able to view data in interesting ways or even create the types of views they'd want to create with it right, so that's simplest way I can phrase it.
To go into exact details
So we have the superadmin section, the agent section, and the admin/manager section
Super Admin:
1. so the super admin is us or me, what the super admin does is to create an organization, and then create an admin for that organization. 
2. So for the super admin, create an organization, create an admin for that organization, and have dashboards for monitoring, metrics and statics, like how many users, organizations etc and any important kpis for the system
3. The admin then has the abilit to perform what's below

Admin: 
Now the admin is the interesting part right, that's where the configurations and analytics are done. The ideas I had for the admin was: 
1. so the admin creates an undertaking, an undertaking in this sense could be like an event, it's what I now call a project, in which the data is going to be collected right, so an undertaking has a start and end date or a given period, during that period, agents or workers collect data, so on the system, an adming/manager creates an undertaking/event (undertaking is now what we call project) 
2. then on creating an undertaking or event, then the admin can create form(s) for that undertaking, usually it's either one form but it could be more, when I say more, the forms are distinct forms in that regards, so one form or multiple distinct forms for a project, and each form could be either one page or stepper forms (for stepper forms, it'd be determined by what the admin decides), then determine the fields and data types for the fields, just like google forms. then save that form for that project
3. now how the agents would get the form to fill, what I thought of is something my company implemented for a system, it was a payroll system right, where there exist a validation window, so here, I'm thinking, since a project has a start and end date or a given period, even though I haven't mentioned it, I'd put it down below, so admins invite agents to their organization, and as such, they get to see the undertakings of their organization, so when the period starts, then they go in, then they can see the forms for that project and start working, so they add a submission, fill the form, save and proceed to the next respondent right. So add a submission, in adding a submission, they fill the form for that respondent, if that project has one form, then that one form is filled for that submission, if that project has multiple forms, then a submission should have that multiple forms, at the moment I"m thinking, they see an add button, enter the repondent name, fill the forms, save, and continue on to the next, so as they make submissions, if they're offline, then saving to local when connected to the internet then it syncs, but if within the range of internet connectivity, then straight sync (so offline first development)
4. alright, still on the admin, so admin can create views, from a form or from each forms for multiple forms of a project undertaking or using two or more forms to create a view, what do I mean by a view, so a view is like a chart, a statistical information, eg. so a form has income, wages, expense, debts etc , and so I want a pie chart of that right, that's a view, so the admin/manager can create multiple views, i.e multiple charts, like pie charts, bar charts, etc ., based on the information in a given form or forms in that project, then when satisfied, proceeds to: 
5. create a dashboard, so like a drag and drop the views then save, if he wants to edit, then edits the dashboard view and saves, and also if he wants multiple dashboard view then something like a tab view (like excel) and create extra dashboards using the same flow, dragging and dropping views to make a dashboard, and that's the general flow I have,
Also, I mentioned earlier something we didn't fully work on, and that's the how the agents get the forms, so because we're trying to do a plug and play, we have a software product with me being the superadmin, then I create an organization, add an admin and hand it over to the admin, the admin then can add agents and other roles I guess, so looking at role management, if an admin is going to create it's own roles, we must find a way for them to manage permissions, at the moment, I think I don't want to over engineer that, so let's keep it to superadmin, admin, and agents so this is the general idea I had, so to flesh out this more, so I've created an organization, I've created an admin, now how does the admin get access, in our development, forgot about this, that's sending emails, alright let's flesh it out here, so I create an admin, I take the email and password, create the admin and then an email is sent to the admin, admin opens the email see's a link to finish or complete their profile, on clicking it, it takes them to a page where they enter their email, their new password and save right, on a successful profile completion, they try to login with their email and new password, on successful login, they then have access to the system. Now to add agents, so they add agents like in a similar manner, for adding agents, they can either add one after the other or bulk, for this they don't have to create a password, a default password can be set for them so you just imput the email to add or have a list of emails in excel format upload it and invitations would be sent to the various agents via email, they click on accept and they come to complete their profile just like admin, enter email and password, then after, they login, upon logging in, that's where the agent section comes in:

Agent:
1. so the agents logs in, sees the project they have to attend, and they woun't be able to make submissions to a project until the start date of that project
2. immediately the project starts, they go in, and start adding a submission
3. because we're trying to design an offline first for this section, they log in with internet, when the internet goes off, they can continue work, continue adding submissions, and when internet comes back on, it just gets sync, that can be done manually or automatically (advise on what is best)
So that's the SaaS product I intended to develop, and this backend codebase has majority of this developed, so I want you to go through the backend codebase, cross-check what functionalities and features have been implemented, what's left to implement, if you could make a list, so that we can start working on it, give a percentage of completion as well, I want to know if the backend is ready so as to proceed  to the client (frontend) side
